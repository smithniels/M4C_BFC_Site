                        <strong>Bread for the City is a comprehensive front line agency serving the poor of Washington, DC.</strong> The agency began sas two organizations: Zacchaeus Free Clinic, which began in 1974 as a volunteer-run free medical clinic, and Bread for the City, a project by a coalition of downtown DC churches created in 1974 to feed and clothe the poor. As of 2011 Bread for the City offered food, clothing, social services, legal representation and medical care without charge to eligible DC residents.

                    <p class='about'>
                        <strong>Food</strong> Bread for the City provides a three-day supply of groceries once a month to clients who fit the following criteria: below 200% of the Federal Poverty level, and are elderly (over 60), or have children under 18 living with them, or have a disability that prevents them from working.

                        <p class='about'>BFC has recently focused its efforts to provide healthier food options to clients, working with a nutritionist to provide a healthy variety of foods. Bread for the City has eliminated trans fats from the food bags and replaced red meat with fish, pork and poultry. In 2005 the agency created the Fit for Fun program, offering regular medical visits and check-in calls, one-on-one nutrition and exercise consultations, and monthly classes meant to teach clients how to make nutritious meals from the ingredients typically found in the bags.</p>
